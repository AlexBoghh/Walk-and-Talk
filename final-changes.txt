Changes to implement:

1. DONE: Minimalist Walk & Talk section with 4 info cards
2. DONE: About section with only "Why We Walk" and animated Ripple Effect (4 cards)
3. TODO: Replace "Happy Walker Stories" testimonials with "Expected Outcomes" section
4. TODO: Remove entire "Yes! Save My Spot" registration section

The Expected Outcomes section should have:
- Research-backed benefits
- Measurable goals
- No fake testimonials since project hasn't started yet
- Focus on what the project aims to achieve
